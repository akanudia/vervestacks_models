## Data, Assumptions & Coverage

### Primary Data Sources

#### Base-Year Power Plant Specifications
- **Global Energy Monitor (GEM)** [🌐](https://globalenergymonitor.org)  
  Open-access database of individual power plants worldwide, including location, capacity, fuel type, commissioning year, and technical specifications.
- **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)** [🌐](https://www.irena.org/Statistics)  
  Global renewable energy capacity and generation statistics (2000–2022), disaggregated by country and technology.
- **EMBER Climate** [🌐](https://ember-climate.org/data/)  
  Global dataset tracking electricity generation, installed capacity, and emissions intensity (2000–2022).

### Data Processing Notes
- **Individual Plant Coverage**: 85.4%% of total capacity from plant-level GEM data
- **Total Capacity Tracked**: 16.6 GW GW from all sources
- **Plants Above Threshold**: 52 individual plants tracked above 100 MW threshold
- **Total Plants Processed**: 101 plants in database
- **Missing Capacity Added**: - **EMBER data**:
  - **bioenergy**: 0.05 GW
  - **gas**: 0.02 GW
- **IRENA data**:
  - **hydro**: 0.77 GW


## Model Structure

### Files Included
- **Source Data**: `source_data/VerveStacks_BGR.xlsx` - the full dataset in a model-agnostic format
- **VEDA Model Files**: Complete model ready for Veda-TIMES execution
- **Scenario Files**: NGFS climate scenarios and policy assumptions


## Temporal Modeling & Timeslice Analysis

### Advanced Stress Period Identification

This model employs sophisticated **statistical scenario generation** to identify critical periods in high-renewable energy systems:

#### 🔥 **Scarcity Periods** - Renewable Shortage Crisis
- Days with lowest renewable energy coverage relative to demand
- Critical for capacity planning and storage requirements
- Identifies when conventional backup power is most needed

#### ⚡ **Surplus Periods** - Renewable Excess Management  
- Days with highest renewable generation exceeding demand
- Essential for curtailment analysis and export/storage strategies
- Shows opportunities for demand shifting and industrial electrification

#### 🌪️ **Volatile Periods** - Operational Challenges
- Days with highest generation variability and unpredictability
- Important for grid stability and flexible resource planning
- Captures rapid ramping requirements for dispatchable assets

### Timeslice Structure Generation
**Multi-Scale Temporal Resolution:**
- **Base Aggregation**: 6 seasons × 8 daily periods = 48 base timeslices
- **Critical Period Enhancement**: Additional segments for identified stress periods


## Quality Assurance

- Cross-validation between IRENA, EMBER, and UNSD statistics
- Capacity-generation consistency checks
- Technology classification verification
- Historical data reconciliation for base year (2022)
- Renewable resource potential validated against REZoning database
- Temporal analysis verified through statistical scenario methods


## Usage Notes
