## Data Sources & Coverage

### Primary Data Sources
- **IRENA**: Renewable energy capacity and generation statistics (2000-2022)
- **EMBER**: Global electricity generation and capacity data (2000-2022)
- **Global Energy Monitor (GEM)**: Individual power plant database with technical specifications
- **NGFS**: Climate scenario projections and carbon pricing trajectories
- **UNSD**: UN energy statistics and demand projections
- **World Energy Outlook (WEO)**: Technology cost and performance assumptions
- **EPA**: Carbon capture and storage retrofit potential

### Data Processing Notes
- **Individual Plant Coverage**: 98.5% of total capacity from plant-level GEM data
- **Total Capacity Tracked**: 344.0 GW from all sources
- **Plants Above Threshold**: 588 individual plants tracked above 100 MW threshold
- **Total Plants Processed**: 683 plants in database
- **Technology Mapping**: Automated mapping using VerveStacks technology classifications

### Missing Capacity Added From:
- **IRENA data**:
  - **solar**: 54.33 GW
  - **wind**: 0.79 GW
  - **hydro**: 11.79 GW
- **EMBER data**:
  - **coal**: 0.64 GW
  - **bioenergy**: 1.5 GW
  - **gas**: 0.29 GW

## Model Structure

### Files Included
- **Source Data**: `source_data/VerveStacks_JPN.xlsx` - Raw data reconciliation between sources
- **VEDA Model Files**: Complete model ready for TIMES/VEDA execution
- **Time Series Data**: Renewable energy profiles and demand patterns
- **Scenario Files**: NGFS climate scenarios and policy assumptions

### Key Methodology Points
- Plant-level data prioritized where available (capacity > 100 MW)
- 588 plants tracked individually above threshold
- Efficiency adjustments applied for calibration to national statistics
- Missing capacity filled using technology-specific statistical estimates
- Regional cost multipliers applied based on country economic indicators

## Quality Assurance
- Cross-validation between IRENA, EMBER, and UNSD statistics
- Capacity-generation consistency checks
- Technology classification verification
- Historical data reconciliation for base year (2022)

## Usage Notes
- This model is generated automatically using VerveStacks methodology
- For questions about specific data sources or methodology, refer to METHODOLOGY_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Model parameters can be adjusted by re-running with different processing options
