## Data, Assumptions & Coverage

### Primary Data Sources

#### Base-Year Power Plant Specifications

- **Global Energy Monitor (GEM)** [🌐](https://globalenergymonitor.org)  
  Open-access database of individual power plants worldwide, including location, capacity, fuel type, commissioning year, and technical specifications.
- **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)** [🌐](https://www.irena.org/Statistics)  
  Global renewable energy capacity and generation statistics (2000–2022), disaggregated by country and technology. Used to calibrate solar, wind and hydro generation.
- **EMBER Climate** [🌐](https://ember-climate.org/data/)  
  Global dataset tracking electricity generation, installed capacity, and emissions intensity (2000–2022), often used to benchmark policy impacts and system transitions. Used to calibrate thermal generation.
- **United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)** [🌐](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/)  
  Official national energy statistics, including fuel inputs, electricity generation, and sectoral breakdowns — used to validate historical power plant operations.

#### Power Sector Policies and Pathways

- **Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)** [🌐](https://www.ngfs.net)  
  Scenario-based projections of electricity demand, CO₂ emissions trajectories, and fuel prices — used to model alternative climate policy futures.
- **EMBER Climate** [🌐](https://ember-climate.org)  
  Renewable energy targets.

#### New Technologies

- **International Energy Agency – World Energy Outlook (IEA WEO)** [🌐](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023)  
  Global assumptions for power generation technologies: capital costs, O&M, efficiency, and learning rates — aligned with IEA scenarios.
- **U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory – Annual Technology Baseline (NREL ATB)** [🌐](https://atb.nrel.gov/)  
  Cost and performance trajectories for renewable and low-carbon power technologies. U.S.-centric, but widely used for international modeling.

#### Technology Assumptions

- **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** [🌐](https://www.epa.gov)  
  Technical parameters for retrofitting fossil plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS), including energy penalties and incremental costs.
- **Integrated Planning Model (IPM)** [🌐](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector-modeling/overview-ipm-platform)  
  U.S.-based modeling platform used to estimate life extension costs, variable O&M, and decommissioning behavior of thermal power plants.
