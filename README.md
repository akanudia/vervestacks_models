## Processing Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Capacity Threshold** | {capacity_threshold} MW | Minimum plant size for individual tracking |
| **Coal CCS Retrofit Capacity** | {coal_ccs_retrofit_capacity_gw} | Total capacity of coal plants eligible for CCS retrofits |
| **Gas CCS Retrofit Capacity** | {gas_ccs_retrofit_capacity_gw} | Total capacity of gas plants eligible for CCS retrofits |


## Data, Assumptions & Coverage

### Primary Data Sources

#### Base-Year Power Plant Specifications
- **Global Energy Monitor (GEM)** [üåê](https://globalenergymonitor.org)  
  Open-access database of individual power plants worldwide, including location, capacity, fuel type, commissioning year, and technical specifications.
- **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)** [üåê](https://www.irena.org/Statistics)  
  Global renewable energy capacity and generation statistics (2000‚Äì2022), disaggregated by country and technology.
- **EMBER Climate** [üåê](https://ember-climate.org/data/)  
  Global dataset tracking electricity generation, installed capacity, and emissions intensity (2000‚Äì2022).

### Data Processing Notes
- **Individual Plant Coverage**: {gem_coverage_pct}% of total capacity from plant-level GEM data
- **Total Capacity Tracked**: {total_capacity_gw} GW from all sources
- **Plants Above Threshold**: {plants_above_threshold} individual plants tracked above {capacity_threshold} MW threshold
- **Total Plants Processed**: {tracked_plants_count} plants in database
- **Missing Capacity Added**: {missing_capacity_summary}


## Model Structure

### Files Included
- **Source Data**: `source_data/VerveStacks_{iso_code}.xlsx` - the full dataset in a model-agnostic format
- **VEDA Model Files**: Complete model ready for Veda-TIMES execution
- **Scenario Files**: NGFS climate scenarios and policy assumptions

### Key Methodology Points
- Plant-level data prioritized where available (capacity > {capacity_threshold} MW)
- {plants_above_threshold} plants tracked individually above threshold
- Efficiency adjustments applied for calibration to national statistics
- Regional cost multipliers applied based on country economic indicators


## Temporal Modeling & Timeslice Analysis

### Advanced Stress Period Identification

This model employs sophisticated **statistical scenario generation** to identify critical periods in high-renewable energy systems:

#### üî• **Scarcity Periods** - Renewable Shortage Crisis
- Days with lowest renewable energy coverage relative to demand
- Critical for capacity planning and storage requirements
- Identifies when conventional backup power is most needed

#### ‚ö° **Surplus Periods** - Renewable Excess Management  
- Days with highest renewable generation exceeding demand
- Essential for curtailment analysis and export/storage strategies
- Shows opportunities for demand shifting and industrial electrification

#### üå™Ô∏è **Volatile Periods** - Operational Challenges
- Days with highest generation variability and unpredictability
- Important for grid stability and flexible resource planning
- Captures rapid ramping requirements for dispatchable assets

### Timeslice Structure Generation
**Multi-Scale Temporal Resolution:**
- **Base Aggregation**: 6 seasons √ó 8 daily periods = 48 base timeslices
- **Critical Period Enhancement**: Additional segments for identified stress periods


## Quality Assurance

- Cross-validation between IRENA, EMBER, and UNSD statistics
- Capacity-generation consistency checks
- Technology classification verification
- Historical data reconciliation for base year (2022)
- Renewable resource potential validated against REZoning database
- Temporal analysis verified through statistical scenario methods


## Usage Notes

- This model is generated automatically using VerveStacks methodology
- Timeslice structure is optimized for high-renewable energy system analysis
- For questions about specific data sources or methodology, refer to online documentation
- Model parameters can be adjusted manually in the model files
- Charts and analysis files are located in `2_ts_design/outputs/BGR/`
