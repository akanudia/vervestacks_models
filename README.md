**Note:** 2022 fossil and bio capacity is calibrated to EMBER and renewable capacities to IRENA. UNSD has incomplete data for fuel consumption, so the calibration is demonstrated against the total CO2 emission reported by EMBER. This shows that the efficiency assumptions are good.

## Renewable Energy Characterization

VerveStacks provides comprehensive renewable energy potential analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution, 
combining global resource assessments with realistic deployment constraints to deliver actionable insights 
for energy system planning.

### **Data Foundation: REZoning Integration**

Our renewable energy characterization builds on the REZoning database, providing detailed potential 
assessments at 50×50 km grid resolution across 190+ countries. This high-resolution spatial data 
captures the nuanced variations in renewable energy resources that are critical for accurate energy 
system modeling.

**Data Sources:**
- **Solar Potential**: REZoning solar resource data with capacity factors and LCOE estimates
- **Wind Onshore**: REZoning onshore wind potential with economic viability assessments  
- **Wind Offshore**: REZoning offshore wind resources with marine-specific constraints
- **Hourly Profiles**: Atlite-derived capacity factor time series for each grid cell

### **Land Use Conflict Resolution: Conservative Overlap Management**

A critical challenge in renewable energy assessment is avoiding double-counting of land areas suitable 
for both solar and wind development. VerveStacks implements a **conservative overlap resolution algorithm** 
that ensures realistic deployment scenarios:

**Most Pessimistic Assumption:**
- When grid cells overlap between solar and wind potential, we apply **LCOE-based allocation**
- The technology with **higher LCOE (less competitive)** receives a **reduced share** of the overlapping area
- This conservative approach ensures our estimates represent **deployable potential** rather than theoretical maximums
- **No double-counting**: Each grid cell contributes to less than the REZoning resource limits in cells with overlap

This methodology reflects real-world deployment patterns where developers choose the most economically 
viable technology for each location, ensuring our supply curves represent **realistic, achievable 
renewable energy potential**.

### **Supply Curve Visualization**

The resulting supply curves reveal the economic characteristics of renewable energy deployment, 
showing how costs evolve as more capacity is developed:

**Chart Features:**
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Capacity**: Economic viability as deployment scales
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Generation**: Resource potential in energy terms
- **Technology Comparison**: Solar, Wind Onshore, and Wind Offshore potential
- **Original vs Landuse-Adjusted**: Impact of conservative overlap management

This analysis provides the foundation for understanding renewable energy economics and informs 
capacity expansion decisions in the VEDA/TIMES energy system models.


## 💧 Hydro Availability Scenarios

### Planning for Hydro Uncertainty

Hydroelectric generation is inherently variable due to seasonal patterns, year-to-year climate variations, and long-term climate change. Traditional energy models often assume constant hydro availability based on historical averages, which can lead to significant underestimation of backup capacity needs and inadequate drought preparedness.

**VerveStacks addresses this critical gap** by generating probabilistic hydro availability scenarios that capture:
- **Natural variability**: Seasonal wet/dry cycles and multi-year persistence
- **Climate change impacts**: Declining mean availability and increasing extremes  
- **Extreme events**: Drought sequences that stress energy systems
- **Country-specific patterns**: Drought thresholds based on historical operational experience

### **Methodology Overview**

Our approach combines **24 years of historical data** (2000-2023) from EMBER Climate with advanced scenario generation to create realistic future pathways:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Extract seasonal patterns, drought frequencies, and country-specific thresholds
2. **Regime Classification**: Model persistence of wet, normal, and dry conditions  
3. **Climate Adjustment**: Apply declining trends and increasing variability
4. **Scenario Generation**: Create 100+ plausible futures preserving historical characteristics

**Key Innovation**: Drought thresholds are derived from each country's bottom 20% of historical capacity factors, ensuring definitions reflect actual operational stress rather than arbitrary percentages.

### **ITA Hydro Profile**

| **Planning Parameter** | **Value** | **Application** |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Hydro Dependency** | N/A% of generation | System vulnerability assessment |
| **P10 (Dry Scenario)** | 21.9% annual average | Security planning, reserve sizing |
| **P50 (Base Scenario)** | 23.0% annual average | Expected case, financial planning |
| **P90 (Wet Scenario)** | 24.7% annual average | Export opportunities, minimum backup |
| **Historical Average** | 27.8% (2000-2023) | Validation benchmark |
| **Drought Threshold** | 24.5% (P20 of historical) | Operational stress indicator |

### **Monthly Availability Patterns**

       alt="Monthly Hydro Availability Profile" 
       style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <p><em>Monthly hydro availability showing P10/P50/P90 future scenarios validated against historical patterns</em></p>
</div>

### **Long-term Trajectory Analysis**

<div align="center">
  <img src="VerveStacks_ITA_grids/source_data/ITA_hydro_annual_trajectory.png" 
       alt="Annual Hydro Availability Trajectory"

  <p><em>Annual hydro trajectories connecting historical data (2000-2023) to future scenarios (2025-2050)</em></p>
</div>

### **Planning Applications**

**Capacity Planning**: Use P50 for base case sizing, verify adequacy with P10 scenarios  
**Investment Analysis**: P10 scenarios for downside risk, P90 for upside potential  
**System Operations**: P10 for emergency preparedness, P50 for maintenance scheduling  
**Policy Analysis**: Understand drought impacts on energy security and backup requirements

**Key Insight**: The future will not match historical averages. Planning for hydro variability using P10/P50/P90 scenarios is essential for reliable, cost-effective energy systems.
