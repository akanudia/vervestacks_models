## Renewable Energy Characterization

VerveStacks provides comprehensive renewable energy potential analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution, 
combining global resource assessments with realistic deployment constraints to deliver actionable insights 
for energy system planning.

### **Data Foundation: REZoning Integration**

Our renewable energy characterization builds on the REZoning database, providing detailed potential 
assessments at 50×50 km grid resolution across 190+ countries. This high-resolution spatial data 
captures the nuanced variations in renewable energy resources that are critical for accurate energy 
system modeling.

**Data Sources:**
- **Solar Potential**: REZoning solar resource data with capacity factors and LCOE estimates
- **Wind Onshore**: REZoning onshore wind potential with economic viability assessments  
- **Wind Offshore**: REZoning offshore wind resources with marine-specific constraints
- **Hourly Profiles**: Atlite-derived capacity factor time series for each grid cell

### **Land Use Conflict Resolution: Conservative Overlap Management**

A critical challenge in renewable energy assessment is avoiding double-counting of land areas suitable 
for both solar and wind development. VerveStacks implements a **conservative overlap resolution algorithm** 
that ensures realistic deployment scenarios:

**Most Pessimistic Assumption:**
- When grid cells overlap between solar and wind potential, we apply **LCOE-based allocation**
- The technology with **higher LCOE (less competitive)** receives a **reduced share** of the overlapping area
- This conservative approach ensures our estimates represent **deployable potential** rather than theoretical maximums
- **No double-counting**: Each grid cell contributes to less than the REZoning resource limits in cells with overlap

This methodology reflects real-world deployment patterns where developers choose the most economically 
viable technology for each location, ensuring our supply curves represent **realistic, achievable 
renewable energy potential**.

### **Supply Curve Visualization**

The resulting supply curves reveal the economic characteristics of renewable energy deployment, 
showing how costs evolve as more capacity is developed:

**Chart Features:**
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Capacity**: Economic viability as deployment scales
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Generation**: Resource potential in energy terms
- **Technology Comparison**: Solar, Wind Onshore, and Wind Offshore potential
- **Original vs Landuse-Adjusted**: Impact of conservative overlap management

<div align="center">

</div>

This analysis provides the foundation for understanding renewable energy economics and informs 
capacity expansion decisions in the VEDA/TIMES energy system models.


### Renewable Energy Clustering

VerveStacks employs **intelligent spatial clustering** to transform high-resolution renewable energy 
grid cells into manageable clusters while preserving essential resource characteristics and geographic diversity.

#### **Clustering Overview**

| **Clustering Metric** | **Value** | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Grid Cells Processed** | 0 | 50×50km renewable energy grid cells |
| **Clusters Generated** | 30 | Dynamically determined using n = cells^0.6 |
| **Average Cluster Size** | 9.8 grid cells | Mean grid cells per cluster |
| **Cluster Size Range** | 5 to 19 grid cells | Variation in cluster composition |
| **Grid Definition** | Grid definition: syn_5 | Transmission infrastructure basis |

#### **Multi-Feature Clustering Algorithm**

The clustering process combines multiple data dimensions to create economically and spatially coherent renewable energy zones:
        
**Technical Implementation:**
- **Algorithm**: Hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage
- **Preprocessing**: PCA dimensionality reduction (50 components per technology)
- **Standardization**: All features normalized before clustering
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance in transformed feature space

#### **Capacity-Weighted Profile Aggregation**

Each cluster receives a **capacity-weighted hourly profile** that preserves the temporal characteristics 
of constituent grid cells while accounting for their relative renewable energy potential:

```
cluster_profile[hour] = Σ(grid_cell_profile[hour] × capacity_weight[cell]) / Σ(capacity_weight[cell])
```

This approach ensures that grid cells with higher renewable energy potential have proportionally 
greater influence on the cluster's temporal generation pattern, maintaining economic rationality 
in the aggregated profiles.

#### **Geographic Hedging Benefits**

**Why Clustering Matters**: Even in non-grid models, renewable energy clustering preserves critical 
**geographic hedging** effects that are essential for realistic energy system modeling:

- **Wind Resource Diversity**: Captures spatial variations in wind patterns and seasonal differences
- **Solar Complementarity**: Preserves east-west and north-south solar resource variations
- **Grid Connection Costs**: Maintains distance-based connection costs to transmission infrastructure
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Geographic diversity reduces overall system variability

**Universal Application**: Both grid and non-grid models use identical clustering methodology, 
differing only in their synthetic grid definition (actual transmission vs. population centers).

#### **Quality Filtering**

Only economically viable renewable resources are included in the clustering process:
- **Solar PV**: Grid cells with <5% capacity factor excluded
- **Onshore Wind**: Grid cells with <8% capacity factor excluded
- **Resource Focus**: Ensures clustering represents deployable potential, not theoretical maximums

#### **Clustering Visualizations**

The following visualizations show the spatial distribution of renewable energy clusters for each technology, 
demonstrating how the algorithm balances resource quality, geographic diversity, and grid connectivity:

## 💧 Hydro Availability Scenarios

### Planning for Hydro Uncertainty

Hydroelectric generation is inherently variable due to seasonal patterns, year-to-year climate variations, and long-term climate change. Traditional energy models often assume constant hydro availability based on historical averages, which can lead to significant underestimation of backup capacity needs and inadequate drought preparedness.

**VerveStacks addresses this critical gap** by generating probabilistic hydro availability scenarios that capture:
- **Natural variability**: Seasonal wet/dry cycles and multi-year persistence
- **Climate change impacts**: Declining mean availability and increasing extremes  
- **Extreme events**: Drought sequences that stress energy systems
- **Country-specific patterns**: Drought thresholds based on historical operational experience

### **Methodology Overview**

Our approach combines **24 years of historical data** (2000-2023) from EMBER Climate with advanced scenario generation to create realistic future pathways:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Extract seasonal patterns, drought frequencies, and country-specific thresholds
2. **Regime Classification**: Model persistence of wet, normal, and dry conditions  
3. **Climate Adjustment**: Apply declining trends and increasing variability
4. **Scenario Generation**: Create 100+ plausible futures preserving historical characteristics

**Key Innovation**: Drought thresholds are derived from each country's bottom 20% of historical capacity factors, ensuring definitions reflect actual operational stress rather than arbitrary percentages.

### **FRA Hydro Profile**

| **Planning Parameter** | **Value** | **Application** |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Hydro Dependency** | N/A% of generation | System vulnerability assessment |
| **P10 (Dry Scenario)** | 23.3% annual average | Security planning, reserve sizing |
| **P50 (Base Scenario)** | 25.2% annual average | Expected case, financial planning |
| **P90 (Wet Scenario)** | 26.8% annual average | Export opportunities, minimum backup |
| **Historical Average** | 28.1% (2000-2023) | Validation benchmark |
| **Drought Threshold** | 26.0% (P20 of historical) | Operational stress indicator |

### **Monthly Availability Patterns**

<div align="center">

  <p><em>Monthly hydro availability showing P10/P50/P90 future scenarios validated against historical patterns</em></p>
</div>

### **Long-term Trajectory Analysis**

<div align="center">
  <img src="VerveStacks_FRA_grids_syn_5/source_data/FRA_hydro_annual_trajectory.png" 
       alt="Annual Hydro Availability Trajectory"

  <p><em>Annual hydro trajectories connecting historical data (2000-2023) to future scenarios (2025-2050)</em></p>
</div>

### **Planning Applications**

**Capacity Planning**: Use P50 for base case sizing, verify adequacy with P10 scenarios  
**Investment Analysis**: P10 scenarios for downside risk, P90 for upside potential  
**System Operations**: P10 for emergency preparedness, P50 for maintenance scheduling  
**Policy Analysis**: Understand drought impacts on energy security and backup requirements

**Key Insight**: The future will not match historical averages. Planning for hydro variability using P10/P50/P90 scenarios is essential for reliable, cost-effective energy systems.
