## Data Sources & Coverage

### Primary Data Sources
**Data Sources**

Base-Year Power Plant Specifications
------------------------------------
- **Global Energy Monitor (GEM)**  
  Open-access database of individual power plants worldwide, including location, capacity, fuel type, commissioning year, and technical specifications.  
  Website: https://globalenergymonitor.org
- **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)**  
  Global renewable energy capacity and generation statistics (2000–2022), disaggregated by country and technology. Used to calibrate solar, wind and hydro generation.
  Website: https://www.irena.org/Statistics
- **EMBER Climate**  
  Global dataset tracking electricity generation, installed capacity, and emissions intensity (2000–2022), often used to benchmark policy impacts and system transitions. Used to calibrate thermal generation.
  Website: https://ember-climate.org/data/
- **United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)**  
  Official national energy statistics, including fuel inputs, electricity generation, and sectoral breakdowns — used to validate historical power plant operations.  
  Website: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/
Power Sector Policies and Pathways
----------------------------------
- **Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)**  
  Scenario-based projections of electricity demand, CO₂ emissions trajectories, and fuel prices — used to model alternative climate policy futures.  
  Website: https://www.ngfs.net
- **EMBER Climate**  
  Renewable energy targets.
New Technologies
----------------
- **International Energy Agency – World Energy Outlook (IEA WEO)**  
  Global assumptions for power generation technologies: capital costs, O&M, efficiency, and learning rates — aligned with IEA scenarios.  
  Website: https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023
- **U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory – Annual Technology Baseline (NREL ATB)**  
  Cost and performance trajectories for renewable and low-carbon power technologies. U.S.-centric, but widely used for international modeling.  
  Website: https://atb.nrel.gov/
Technology Assumptions
---------------------------------------
- **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**  
  Technical parameters for retrofitting fossil plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS), including energy penalties and incremental costs.  
  Website: https://www.epa.gov
- **Integrated Planning Model (IPM)**  
  U.S.-based modeling platform used to estimate life extension costs, variable O&M, and decommissioning behavior of thermal power plants.
