## üåç **The Open Use Vision**

> *"The open USE platform ¬∑ Powered by data ¬∑ Shaped by vision ¬∑ Guided by intuition ¬∑ Fueled by passion"*

**VerveStacks represents a paradigm shift from "Open Source" to "Open Use"** - the source code remains **closed and proprietary**, but the **outputs are completely transparent and freely available**. This closed-source approach enables rapid innovation and quality control while delivering **pre-built, professional-grade models** that users can immediately apply without needing structural modification capabilities.

### **The Problem: Energy Modeling Apartheid**
- **Months of Expertise Required**: Traditional TIMES modeling demands specialized skills most don't have
- **Global Inequality**: Decision-makers in developing countries lack access to credible, usable models
- **Bottleneck Misidentification**: The constraint isn't model application - it's model availability
- **Blackbox Syndrome**: Even "open" models often remain opaque in practice
- **The Builder's Habit**: Energy modelers instinctively want to "start from the input" - but **users don't need to understand the motherboard to use a computer**

### **Our Solution: Democratization Through Controlled Automation**
**VerveStacks is the beginning of an Energy System Operating System (ESOM OS)** - a **closed-source platform** that transforms energy modeling from an artisanal craft into an automated, transparent, globally accessible utility. The **structural freedom** of the closed-source approach enables rapid delivery of **free, professional-grade models** to users worldwide.

## üöÄ **ESOM OS: The Energy System Operating System**

Just as computer operating systems democratized computing by abstracting complexity, **VerveStacks ESOM OS democratizes energy modeling** by providing a comprehensive platform where users focus on **applying models** rather than **building them**.

### **Breaking the Builder's Habit**

**The energy modeling community has a deeply ingrained habit**: when encountering a model, the instinct is to **"start from the input"** - to understand every dataset, every assumption, every line of code. This is like trying to understand your computer by examining the top-left corner of the motherboard.

**VerveStacks deliberately breaks this habit** by being **closed-source**:

- **For Builders**: Plenty of excellent open-source options already exist (OSeMOSYS, PyPSA, SWITCH, etc.)
- **For Users**: VerveStacks provides **finished, professional models** ready for immediate application
- **The Paradigm Shift**: From "How was this built?" to "What can I do with this?"
- **User-Centric Design**: Like using a smartphone - you don't need to understand the chipset to make a call

**This is not easy** - breaking decades of academic tradition requires **deliberate design choices**. Closed-source forces users to engage with **outputs and applications** rather than **inputs and construction**.

### **Core Philosophy: The Restaurant Analogy**
- **Traditional Open Source**: Gives you the recipe and ingredients - you still need to be a master chef
- **VerveStacks Open Use**: Delivers a **professionally prepared meal** - you focus on enjoying and applying it
- **Closed-Source Advantage**: The chef's **structural freedom** in the kitchen enables **free delivery** of gourmet meals to everyone
- **Result**: Users get **immediate value** without needing cooking skills or kitchen access

### **Methodological Innovations**

#### **üî• Stress-Based Timeslice Design**
Revolutionary approach to temporal modeling that identifies when storage and ramping face maximum operational stress:

**Core Innovation**: Instead of fixed timeslice structures, VerveStacks identifies critical periods through coverage analysis:
1. **Baseline Construction**: Current demand profile with existing nuclear (flat dispatch) and hydro (load-following within monthly constraints)
2. **Renewable Portfolio**: Solar/wind mix based on relative LCOEs from REZoning data to meet annual demand
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Calculate hourly renewable supply adequacy: `Coverage = (Solar + Wind + Hydro) / Demand √ó 100%`
4. **Stress Period Identification**: Rank days/weeks by scarcity (<100%), surplus (>100%), and volatility (high variability)
5. **Intelligent Aggregation**: Select combinations of critical periods to create 1-600 timeslices based on system complexity

**Result**: Timeslices capture the periods that matter most for grid operations - when storage must work hardest, ramping is most critical, and dispatchable generation faces peak demand.

#### **üèóÔ∏è Comprehensive Model Architecture**

**Demand Modeling**:
- **Electricity Demand**: Base year from EMBER data, growth from AR6 scenarios with ISO-R10 climate mapping
- **Sectoral Profiles**: ERA5 hourly profiles split into industry/residential/commercial sectors
- **Hydrogen Demand**: Zero base year, future projected as share of electricity demand from AR6 scenarios

**Generation Portfolio**:
- **Existing Plants**: Individual units from Global Energy Monitor (40,000+ plants) with vintage-based parameters
- **Missing Capacity**: Gap-filled from EMBER/IRENA with appropriate utilization profiles from Atlite
- **Technology Costs**: Efficiency and cost assumptions based on region, size, and commissioning vintage
- **CCS Integration**: Retrofit options for existing units using EPA Table 6 methodology ($30/t CO2 transport/storage)
- **New Technologies**: Conventional plants from IEA WEO, renewables from REZoning, storage from NREL

**Renewable Resource Modeling**:
- **Spatial Resolution**: 50√ó50km grid cells from REZoning with Atlite weather profiles
- **Conservative Potentials**: Reduced by 40% (solar) and 30% (wind) for land-use constraints
- **Cost-Performance Classes**: 15-30 LCOE-capacity factor categories per technology
- **Realistic Portfolio Selection**: Balanced relevant resource approach prevents technology monopolization

#### **üó∫Ô∏è Voronoi Spatial Clustering** 
Mathematically rigorous regional modeling that scales from small countries (4 regions) to large countries (400+ regions):
- **Multi-Resolution Clustering**: Separate demand regions, generation clusters, and renewable zones
- **Trade Link Optimization**: Connections from generation/renewable clusters to closest demand centers
- **Transmission Modeling**: NTC estimation using OpenStreetMap data with distance-based efficiency/cost calculations
- **Flexible Aggregation**: Unit-level detail for plants >100MW, intelligent aggregation below threshold
- **Non-Overlapping Guarantee**: Voronoi construction ensures mathematically consistent regional boundaries

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Vintage-Based Technology Modeling**
Realistic representation of existing infrastructure that captures the full complexity of real energy systems:
- **Age-Dependent Parameters**: Efficiency degradation and cost variations by commissioning year
- **Retrofit Pathways**: CCS integration options with realistic capacity and efficiency penalties
- **Regional Cost Adjustments**: Country-specific multipliers reflecting local economic conditions
- **Multi-Source Reconciliation**: Systematic gap-filling across GEM, EMBER, and IRENA datasets
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation ensuring capacity totals match official statistics

#### **üìä Integrated Scenario Framework**
- **Climate Trajectories**: IPCC AR6 scenarios mapped to 5 climate categories with sectoral electricity splits
- **Time Horizon**: Flexible modeling periods (default: 2022, 2025-2050 in 5-year steps)
