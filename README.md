## Model Calibration 2022

| **Total Capacity** | **Total Generation** | **CO2 Emissions** | **Calibration to EMBER** |
|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|
| 66 GW | 239 TWh | 189 Mt | 109% |

**Note:** 2022 fossil and bio capacity is calibrated to EMBER and renewable capacities to IRENA. UNSD has incomplete data for fuel consumption, so the calibration is demonstrated against the total CO2 emission reported by EMBER. This shows that the efficiency assumptions are good.

## Renewable Energy Characterization

VerveStacks provides comprehensive renewable energy potential analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution, 
combining global resource assessments with realistic deployment constraints to deliver actionable insights 
for energy system planning.

### **Data Foundation: REZoning Integration**

Our renewable energy characterization builds on the REZoning database, providing detailed potential 
assessments at 50×50 km grid resolution across 190+ countries. This high-resolution spatial data 
captures the nuanced variations in renewable energy resources that are critical for accurate energy 
system modeling.

**Data Sources:**
- **Solar Potential**: REZoning solar resource data with capacity factors and LCOE estimates
- **Wind Onshore**: REZoning onshore wind potential with economic viability assessments  
- **Wind Offshore**: REZoning offshore wind resources with marine-specific constraints
- **Hourly Profiles**: Atlite-derived capacity factor time series for each grid cell

### **Land Use Conflict Resolution: Conservative Overlap Management**

A critical challenge in renewable energy assessment is avoiding double-counting of land areas suitable 
for both solar and wind development. VerveStacks implements a **conservative overlap resolution algorithm** 
that ensures realistic deployment scenarios:

**Most Pessimistic Assumption:**
- When grid cells overlap between solar and wind potential, we apply **LCOE-based allocation**
- The technology with **higher LCOE (less competitive)** receives a **reduced share** of the overlapping area
- This conservative approach ensures our estimates represent **deployable potential** rather than theoretical maximums
- **No double-counting**: Each grid cell contributes to less than the REZoning resource limits in cells with overlap

This methodology reflects real-world deployment patterns where developers choose the most economically 
viable technology for each location, ensuring our supply curves represent **realistic, achievable 
renewable energy potential**.

### **Supply Curve Visualization**

The resulting supply curves reveal the economic characteristics of renewable energy deployment, 
showing how costs evolve as more capacity is developed:

**Chart Features:**
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Capacity**: Economic viability as deployment scales
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Generation**: Resource potential in energy terms
- **Technology Comparison**: Solar, Wind Onshore, and Wind Offshore potential
- **Original vs Landuse-Adjusted**: Impact of conservative overlap management

This analysis provides the foundation for understanding renewable energy economics and informs 
capacity expansion decisions in the VEDA/TIMES energy system models.


### Renewable Energy Clustering

VerveStacks employs **intelligent spatial clustering** to transform high-resolution renewable energy 
grid cells into manageable clusters while preserving essential resource characteristics and geographic diversity.

#### **Clustering Overview**

| **Clustering Metric** | **Value** | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Grid Cells Processed** | 534 | 50×50km renewable energy grid cells |
| **Clusters Generated** | 43 | Dynamically determined using n = cells^0.6 |
| **Average Cluster Size** | 12.4 grid cells | Mean grid cells per cluster |
| **Cluster Size Range** | 4 to 34 grid cells | Variation in cluster composition |
| **Grid Definition** | Cities as transmission bus proxies | Transmission infrastructure basis |

#### **Multi-Feature Clustering Algorithm**

The clustering process combines multiple data dimensions to create economically and spatially coherent renewable energy zones:
        
**Technical Implementation:**
- **Algorithm**: Hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage
- **Preprocessing**: PCA dimensionality reduction (50 components per technology)
- **Standardization**: All features normalized before clustering
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance in transformed feature space

#### **Capacity-Weighted Profile Aggregation**

Each cluster receives a **capacity-weighted hourly profile** that preserves the temporal characteristics 
of constituent grid cells while accounting for their relative renewable energy potential:

```
cluster_profile[hour] = Σ(grid_cell_profile[hour] × capacity_weight[cell]) / Σ(capacity_weight[cell])
```

This approach ensures that grid cells with higher renewable energy potential have proportionally 
greater influence on the cluster's temporal generation pattern, maintaining economic rationality 
in the aggregated profiles.

#### **Geographic Hedging Benefits**

**Why Clustering Matters**: Even in non-grid models, renewable energy clustering preserves critical 
**geographic hedging** effects that are essential for realistic energy system modeling:

- **Wind Resource Diversity**: Captures spatial variations in wind patterns and seasonal differences
- **Solar Complementarity**: Preserves east-west and north-south solar resource variations
- **Grid Connection Costs**: Maintains distance-based connection costs to transmission infrastructure
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Geographic diversity reduces overall system variability

**Universal Application**: Both grid and non-grid models use identical clustering methodology, 
differing only in their synthetic grid definition (actual transmission vs. population centers).

#### **Quality Filtering**

Only economically viable renewable resources are included in the clustering process:
- **Solar PV**: Grid cells with <5% capacity factor excluded
- **Onshore Wind**: Grid cells with <8% capacity factor excluded
- **Resource Focus**: Ensures clustering represents deployable potential, not theoretical maximums

#### **Clustering Visualizations**

The following visualizations show the spatial distribution of renewable energy clusters for each technology, 
demonstrating how the algorithm balances resource quality, geographic diversity, and grid connectivity:
