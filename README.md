- **U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory – Annual Technology Baseline (NREL ATB)**  
  Cost and performance trajectories for renewable and low-carbon technologies, primarily for the U.S., but widely used globally.  
  Website: https://atb.nrel.gov/
- **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**  
  Technical parameters for retrofitting existing power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS), including energy penalties and cost factors.  
  Website: https://www.epa.gov
- **Integrated Planning Model (IPM)**  
  U.S.-based modeling platform used to estimate life extension, variable O&M, and retirement costs of thermal power plants.

### Data Processing Notes
- **Individual Plant Coverage**: 94.3% of total capacity from plant-level GEM data
- **Total Capacity Tracked**: 558.8 GW from all sources
- **Plants Above Threshold**: 489 individual plants tracked above 500 MW threshold
- **Total Plants Processed**: 665 plants in database
- **Technology Mapping**: Automated mapping using VerveStacks technology classifications

### Missing Capacity Added From:
- **EMBER data**:
  - **bioenergy**: 9.73 GW
  - **gas**: 5.03 GW
- **IRENA data**:
  - **solar**: 1.1 GW
  - **wind**: 8.92 GW
  - **hydro**: 5.06 GW

## Model Structure

### Files Included
- **Source Data**: `source_data/VerveStacks_IND.xlsx` - Raw data reconciliation between sources
- **VEDA Model Files**: Complete model ready for TIMES/VEDA execution
- **Time Series Data**: Renewable energy profiles and demand patterns
