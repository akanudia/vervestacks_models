## Renewable Energy Characterization

VerveStacks provides comprehensive renewable energy potential analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution, 
combining global resource assessments with realistic deployment constraints to deliver actionable insights 
for energy system planning.

### **Data Foundation: REZoning Integration**

Our renewable energy characterization builds on the REZoning database, providing detailed potential 
assessments at 50×50 km grid resolution across 190+ countries. This high-resolution spatial data 
captures the nuanced variations in renewable energy resources that are critical for accurate energy 
system modeling.

**Data Sources:**
- **Solar Potential**: REZoning solar resource data with capacity factors and LCOE estimates
- **Wind Onshore**: REZoning onshore wind potential with economic viability assessments  
- **Wind Offshore**: REZoning offshore wind resources with marine-specific constraints
- **Hourly Profiles**: Atlite-derived capacity factor time series for each grid cell

### **Land Use Conflict Resolution: Conservative Overlap Management**

A critical challenge in renewable energy assessment is avoiding double-counting of land areas suitable 
for both solar and wind development. VerveStacks implements a **conservative overlap resolution algorithm** 
that ensures realistic deployment scenarios:

**Most Pessimistic Assumption:**
- When grid cells overlap between solar and wind potential, we apply **LCOE-based allocation**
- The technology with **higher LCOE (less competitive)** receives a **reduced share** of the overlapping area
- This conservative approach ensures our estimates represent **deployable potential** rather than theoretical maximums
- **No double-counting**: Each grid cell contributes to less than the REZoning resource limits in cells with overlap

This methodology reflects real-world deployment patterns where developers choose the most economically 
viable technology for each location, ensuring our supply curves represent **realistic, achievable 
renewable energy potential**.

### **Supply Curve Visualization**

The resulting supply curves reveal the economic characteristics of renewable energy deployment, 
showing how costs evolve as more capacity is developed:

**Chart Features:**
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Capacity**: Economic viability as deployment scales
- **LCOE vs Cumulative Generation**: Resource potential in energy terms
- **Technology Comparison**: Solar, Wind Onshore, and Wind Offshore potential
- **Original vs Landuse-Adjusted**: Impact of conservative overlap management
